<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Full forty years have passed and gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since early on a winter’s morn,</p>
<p class="verse0">My infant eyes first struck the light.</p>
<p class="verse0">At once I showed my baby-spite,</p>
<p class="verse0">To find my new abode so plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">And half resolved I’d not remain.</p>
<p class="verse0">If I had unexpected come,</p>
<p class="verse0">And found this unpretending home,</p>
<p class="verse0">I might the negligence excused,</p>
<p class="verse0">But now I felt I was abused.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">For half a year the fact was known</p>
<p class="verse0">That I was on the road to town,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the neighbors, far and near,</p>
<p class="verse0">Said, “Doctor’d bring a baby here.”</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And so I came at dawn of day,</p>
<p class="verse0">A-crying, too, I’ve heard them say,</p>
<p class="verse0">And found few preparations made&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">I’ve often wondered that I stayed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Plain petticoats and untrimmed slips,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pewter spoons that scratched my lips,</p>
<p class="verse0">A cradle made of painted pine,</p>
<p class="verse0">That rocked so rough it made me whine;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then three long hours every day</p>
<p class="verse0">The colic checked my baby play;</p>
<p class="verse0">For months this griping kept me riled,</p>
<p class="verse0">And nearly set my mother wild.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">At last our troubles seemed to wane,</p>
<p class="verse0">I thought I’d bid adieu to pain,</p>
<p class="verse0">When teething time, with all its pangs,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commenced its course with piercing twangs;</p>
<p class="verse0">My mother’d walk the floor by day&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">My pa by night, I’ve heard them say.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">My father, jolly, good, and kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Would often half make up his mind</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">To slap me soundly if I cried,</p>
<p class="verse0">But his heart would fail him when he tried,</p>
<p class="verse0">And as he tossed and dandled me</p>
<p class="verse0">In drowsiness upon his knee,</p>
<p class="verse0">They say the more he nursed and tried,</p>
<p class="verse0">The more I always screamed and cried,</p>
<p class="verse0">And often would each soul alarm</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon our little one-horse farm.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">These trials lasted just a year,</p>
<p class="verse0">The coast again seemed getting-clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">When all at once the whooping-cough</p>
<p class="verse0">Attacked and nearly took me off.</p>
<p class="verse0">For nine long weeks I whooped and choked,</p>
<p class="verse0">While mother nursed and father joked&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">He was always great to jest and pun,</p>
<p class="verse0">And turn all troubles into fun&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">He said the <em>crisis</em> now was here,</p>
<p class="verse0">And we had nothing worse to fear.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Alas! his jesting hopes were vain,</p>
<p class="verse0">The whooping-cough did not remain,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">But measles next came breaking out,</p>
<p class="verse0">The pimples showing, little doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Another seige was'">Another siege was</ins> mine to bear.</p>
<p class="verse0">“To all the ills that flesh was heir,”</p>
<p class="verse0">I felt my infant lot was given,</p>
<p class="verse0">And really wished I was in heaven.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">But quiet comfort did arrive,</p>
<p class="verse0">And I began to grow and thrive,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ma and pa could take their rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thought themselves supremely blest.</p>
<p class="verse0">Just then I first began to talk;</p>
<p class="verse0">At later date, I learned to walk;</p>
<p class="verse0">But stammered out my early say,</p>
<p class="verse0">And stumbled on my infant way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till one bright morn in early June,</p>
<p class="verse0">A baby “brought in a balloon,”</p>
<p class="verse0">Unjoints my little Grecian nose,</p>
<p class="verse0">My infant ire at once arose.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Our family now was much too large,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then it was a fearful charge</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">For mother, who had much to do.</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d try to put the baby through.</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d feel its tiny foot, and sly</p>
<p class="verse0">Would pinch or scratch, and make it cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or rub its head, with look so meek,</p>
<p class="verse0">And pull its hair or pinch its cheek;</p>
<p class="verse0">And mother would at once begin</p>
<p class="verse0">To look for the offending pin,</p>
<p class="verse0">That made the “baby waby” shriek,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ne’er dreaming it was Bessie’s freak.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, at the early age of three,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being bad as bad could be,</p>
<p class="verse0">I never was a minute mute,</p>
<p class="verse0">And people thought me smart and cute;</p>
<p class="verse0">The baby was, I’m glad to say,</p>
<p class="verse0">More good and quiet in its way&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Not half the trouble I had been&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Unless I stuck it with a pin,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or rocked it hard, and made it cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">You scarce would know the babe was by.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So time rolled on, and I intent</p>
<p class="verse0">On infant mischief, came and went,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Till little sister learned to talk.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas I that taught her first to walk;</p>
<p class="verse0">She’d tumble down&mdash;I’d pull her through</p>
<p class="verse0">And scold her well, and shake her too.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then she would totter on and cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">While I would chase a butterfly,</p>
<p class="verse0">And leave her standing in the lane,</p>
<p class="verse0">A-wondering when I’d come again.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Around the barn we used to roam,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or any place away from home;</p>
<p class="verse0">We hand-in-hand would tramp and play,</p>
<p class="verse0">From early morn till close of day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upsetting all the honest nests</p>
<p class="verse0">That enterprising hens possessed,</p>
<p class="verse0">And loving little ducks to death,</p>
<p class="verse0">And out of chickens squeeze the breath,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till mother’d come and frown and fuss,</p>
<p class="verse0">And father, too, to save a muss.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Then homeward bound you’d see us go,</p>
<p class="verse0">The family party in a row,</p>
<p class="verse0">But I was nearly always last,</p>
<p class="verse0">For when my penitence was past,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">I stopped at times upon the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">To finish my neglected play;</p>
<p class="verse0">And father laughed and mother’d scold</p>
<p class="verse0">About the black sheep of the fold.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Thus matters stood when I was five,</p>
<p class="verse0">The hardest little case alive.</p>
<p class="verse0">We spent the hottest summer days</p>
<p class="verse0">Working hard at baby-plays,</p>
<p class="verse0">Making pies of mud and clay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hauling sand and dirt away;</p>
<p class="verse0">Through grass and puddles we would wade,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till we a hill or ditch had made.</p>
<p class="verse0">With muddy dresses, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'towsled hair'">tousled hair</ins>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And dirty faces, we’d repair</p>
<p class="verse0">From lane to road, from road to lane,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through dirt and dust, through sun and rain.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Our infant lives were passing by,</p>
<p class="verse0">When all at once, we scarce knew why,</p>
<p class="verse0">A shadow came upon our home,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all our household filled with gloom.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Our father, ever good and kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was taken from our midst, to find</p>
<p class="verse0">A better home beyond the skies,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which lasting happiness supplies,</p>
<p class="verse0">And mother and five little ones</p>
<p class="verse0">Were left to tread the world alone.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">But blessings came from every friend</p>
<p class="verse0">That could a kind assistance lend;</p>
<p class="verse0">Our lot, though lonely, sad, and scant,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was brightened and relieved from want</p>
<p class="verse0">For kindred hearts, with willing hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gave shelter to our orphan band.</p>
<p class="verse0">Our home, of course, must scattered be</p>
<p class="verse0">To suit the sad emergency.</p>
<p class="verse0">Our little circle’s severed ties</p>
<p class="verse0">Dimmed my mother’s loving eyes,</p>
<p class="verse0">But still her grateful heart was glad</p>
<p class="verse0">To know the help and hope we had.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">I thought in this extremity,</p>
<p class="verse0">There’d be a wondrous rush for me,</p>
<p class="verse0">That I’d be claimed by all our kin,</p>
<p class="verse0">But found myself quite taken in.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">My country aunts took all the rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though, after all, we fared the best.</p>
<p class="verse0">The oldest boy, my brother Joe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who helped my father plough and hoe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was my especial pet and pride,</p>
<p class="verse0">Now, since brother Sam had died.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, when my city aunt arrived</p>
<p class="verse0">To take her pick, at once, I strived</p>
<p class="verse0">To be selected as her choice,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Joe was pet among the boys,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then we could together go,</p>
<p class="verse0">The city sights each other show.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, sure enough, our aunty came</p>
<p class="verse0">A-riding grandly up the lane,</p>
<p class="verse0">And caught me in my dishabille,</p>
<p class="verse0">Much against my wayward will;</p>
<p class="verse0">For I had hoped she’d find me clean,</p>
<p class="verse0">That she might then and there have seen</p>
<p class="verse0">How well I’d look in city guise.</p>
<p class="verse0">Why did she take me by surprise?</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">The Diamond State was then our home,</p>
<p class="verse0">And aunty came from Quakerdom,</p>
<p class="verse0">A-looking prim and quite severe,</p>
<p class="verse0">But still, I felt I needn’t fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">For I had much to recommend</p>
<p class="verse0">My ladyship, you may depend.</p>
<p class="verse0">I dressed myself with special care,</p>
<p class="verse0">And put on quite a company air;</p>
<p class="verse0">And, strutting past my maiden aunt,</p>
<p class="verse0">I wondered what more she could want;</p>
<p class="verse0">She put her specs upon her nose,</p>
<p class="verse0">And closely scanned my country clothes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And asked if I was always good;</p>
<p class="verse0">Never naughty, pert, or rude.</p>
<p class="verse0">I shunned her kind but searching eye,</p>
<p class="verse0">And half resolved, I’d not reply,</p>
<p class="verse0">As I had nothing good to tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">My silence might do just as well.</p>
<p class="verse0">I thought she’d find out, soon enough,</p>
<p class="verse0">My manners were a little rough,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did not want to disenchant</p>
<p class="verse0">My new-made friend, and city aunt.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, looking meek and kind of shy,</p>
<p class="verse0">I paused, before I made reply;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then told her sometimes I was bad,</p>
<p class="verse0">But blamed the company that I had;</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas never any fault of mine,</p>
<p class="verse0">If ever I cut up a shine,</p>
<p class="verse0">And any mischief that was done</p>
<p class="verse0">Was nearly always just for fun.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So aunty smiled, and hoped I’d be</p>
<p class="verse0">A little lady, and she’d see</p>
<p class="verse0">If she could take me up to town,</p>
<p class="verse0">And try to tone my manners down.</p>
<p class="verse0">I then, at once, desired to know,</p>
<p class="verse0">If she couldn’t take my brother, Joe.</p>
<p class="verse0">She said she rather thought she would,</p>
<p class="verse0">If both would promise to be good.</p>
<p class="verse0">So off, in haste, I quickly ran,</p>
<p class="verse0">To tell of aunty’s pleasant plan,</p>
<p class="verse0">To dream of city’s new delights,</p>
<p class="verse0">And think of all the wondrous sights</p>
<p class="verse0">That soon would greet our verdant eyes</p>
<p class="verse0">And fill our hearts with glad surprise.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">So, then we soon began to pack&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Our outfit most was on our back&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Our trunks and traps were small and few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which, fortunately, aunty knew.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, on a balmy, summer day,</p>
<p class="verse0">We all prepared to start away</p>
<p class="verse0">To leave our home and mother, kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in the world our lot to find;</p>
<p class="verse0">When will life ever seem as bright</p>
<p class="verse0">As that receding from our sight?</p>
<p class="verse0">So, slowly riding down the lane</p>
<p class="verse0">We ne’er could call our own again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor mother wept in silent woe,</p>
<p class="verse0">But thought it best for us to go.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, next you’ll see the orphan pair</p>
<p class="verse0">In the midst of city’s stifled air;</p>
<p class="verse0">No fields, no lanes, no trees to climb,</p>
<p class="verse0">A-wondering how we’d kill the time.</p>
<p class="verse0">What earthly goods we’d gladly give,</p>
<p class="verse0">To get back home again to live!</p>
<p class="verse0">Our aunty, sensible and kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Told us to leave regrets behind,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And, in her wise and pleasant way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Informed us, life was not all play.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">But childhood’s troubles seldom last</p>
<p class="verse0">Much longer than the cause is past.</p>
<p class="verse0">The city soon began to be</p>
<p class="verse0">A wonder and a joy to me;</p>
<p class="verse0">My aunty got me pretty clothes</p>
<p class="verse0">And taught me how to turn my toes;</p>
<p class="verse0">She’d dress me up so clean and sweet</p>
<p class="verse0">And send me out into the street.</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d miss the “pies” and “puddles” there</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the gutters I’d repair,</p>
<p class="verse0">And play and paddle there in glee,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till I was summoned in to tea.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">My vixen spirit, as of old,</p>
<p class="verse0">New mischief daily would unfold,</p>
<p class="verse0">And aunty shuddered, as she saw</p>
<p class="verse0">How little I respected law;</p>
<p class="verse0">So, wishing me to live by rule,</p>
<p class="verse0">She entered me, at once, in school.</p>

<p class="verse0">One Monday morn in early Fall</p>
<p class="verse0">We made the nearest school a call,</p>

<p class="verse0">All mischief and frivolity,</p>
<p class="verse0">And strictly stick to A, B, C.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">The teacher showed a little doubt&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse0">I did not like the busy looks</p>
<p class="verse0">Of slates and pencils, chalk and books&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">I felt I’d much prefer to be</p>
<p class="verse0">A stranger to my A, B, C.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">I knew more now, at any rate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than many children did at eight,</p>

<p class="verse0">I showed my feelings in my face,</p>

<p class="verse0">At once enrolled my naughty name</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the future book of fame.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">I then and there began to climb</p>
<p class="verse0">The hill of science; oh! the time</p>
<p class="verse0">It took to teach me how to do;</p>
<p class="verse0">But I fought it out, and struggled through.</p>
<p class="verse0">The teacher seldom suited me&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Indeed, we never could agree;</p>
<p class="verse0">Her notions always seem so queer,</p>
<p class="verse0">I wondered why they put her there;</p>
<p class="verse0">And aunty, too, was odd as she,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both seemed to be opposed to me.</p>

<p class="verse0">At times my patience would give out;</p>
<p class="verse0">You couldn’t play a bit without</p>

<p class="verse0">A little laugh would make a muss.</p>
<p class="verse0">You couldn’t talk in any peace,</p>

<p class="verse0">That made you want to look behind&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">You might have just as well been blind,</p>

<p class="verse0">She always kept you kind of scared.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">No matter what you had to say,</p>
<p class="verse0">She’d surely look another way,</p>

<p class="verse0">Slate and pencil, book and chalk;</p>
<p class="verse0">Were ever at her finger ends&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">I wonder she had any friends.</p>
<p class="verse0">Indeed, she hadn’t many there,</p>

<p class="verse0">They seemed to think her very nice;</p>
<p class="verse0">I wished they’d taken my advice,</p>
<p class="verse0">And never mind a word she said;</p>
<p class="verse0">They soon would found, what motive led</p>
<p class="verse0">Her to appear so sweet to them,</p>
<p class="verse0">And that she wasn’t such a gem.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">She had a special spite at me,</p>

<p class="verse0">Whether I would work or play;</p>
<p class="verse0">And then she’d often keep me in,</p>
<p class="verse0">For just a little bit of sin,</p>
<p class="verse0">That no one else would scarcely see&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">She was just as mean as mean could be.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">If it hadn’t been for family pride,</p>
<p class="verse0">I think I’d left that school or died;</p>

<p class="verse0">My failing was behaving bad,</p>
<p class="verse0">At least that’s what the teacher said;</p>
<p class="verse0">But she was always saying things,</p>
<p class="verse0">And telling tales that trouble brings.</p>
<p class="verse0">I’ve left her class, I’m glad to say&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">I’ll try a new one now to-day.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

<p class="verse0">Alas, a-lack-a-day&mdash;ah! me,</p>
<p class="verse0">I fear we too will disagree;</p>
<p class="verse0">There’s much that’s new I want to know,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ask the girls if they will show</p>
<p class="verse0">Exactly how the things are done,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besides we want a little fun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just to cheer us as we learn&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">The teachers are so stiff and stern,</p>
<p class="verse0">I wouldn’t be one for a farm&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">They do the children so much harm;</p>
<p class="verse0">Though aunty said to-night at tea</p>
<p class="verse0">That’s what she’s going to make of me.</p>
<p class="verse0">I don’t know what I’ve ever done</p>
<p class="verse0">To her, indeed to any one,</p>
<p class="verse0">That I should suffer such a fate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or learn a trade I love to hate.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">I tell you what, when I get big,</p>
<p class="verse0">You’ll see me dance a different jig;</p>
<p class="verse0">I won’t be sober, staid, and stern,</p>
<p class="verse0">And try to make the children learn.</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor little things, I’ll let them be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Remembering how it was with me.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Just worry, lecture, preach, and scold,</p>
<p class="verse0">Enough to make a young one old.</p>
<p class="verse0">At school and home I had no rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was always getting blamed or blest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And mostly too without a cause,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just for breaking little laws,</p>
<p class="verse0">That never should, by rights, been made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor never would by Bessie’s aid.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, thus my early life was spent,</p>
<p class="verse0">From class to class I yearly went;</p>
<p class="verse0">Each teacher seemed to be my foe,</p>
<p class="verse0">And quite content to have me go;</p>
<p class="verse0">But still I had my share of fun,</p>
<p class="verse0">In spite of all the scolding done.</p>
<p class="verse0">In tricks and pranks I took delight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And misbehaved with all my might;</p>
<p class="verse0">In tact and lessons I excelled,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or I should long since been expelled.</p>
<p class="verse0">The merits that I got to-day</p>
<p class="verse0">To-morrow’s marks would wipe away.</p>

<p class="verse0">Remorse and resolution firm</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Would fill me with a new desire;</p>
<p class="verse0">But “all the fat was in the fire”</p>
<p class="verse0">The minute mischief crossed my way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which it, alas! did every day.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Thus school life, with its hopes and fears&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">At least the first short seven years&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Was drawing nearly to a close,</p>
<p class="verse0">When, all at once, the question rose&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">What should next be done with me.</p>
<p class="verse0">The teachers gladly did agree,</p>
<p class="verse0">That I should try my luck and leave&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">The high-school might my name retrieve.</p>
<p class="verse0">So I studied hard, both night and day,</p>
<p class="verse0">(But leisure took for fun and play),</p>
<p class="verse0">Till testing time, with questions hard,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brought me my happy hope’s reward.</p>
<p class="verse0">I did not pass with honors high&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">I guess you know the reason why;</p>
<p class="verse0">But still I passed, and was content,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to my laurels proudly went,</p>
<p class="verse0">And talked as big and looked as wise</p>
<p class="verse0">As those that got the highest prize;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And felt it was a happy school,</p>
<p class="verse0">Possessing such a precious jewel.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">So, at the age of green fourteen,</p>
<p class="verse0">I felt as proud as any queen.</p>
<p class="verse0">A new leaf I resolved to turn,</p>
<p class="verse0">And study hard and laurels earn;</p>
<p class="verse0">I stood quite high for one so young,</p>
<p class="verse0">And could I only held my tongue</p>
<p class="verse0">I might have been almost a star,</p>
<p class="verse0">But mischief would my merits mar;</p>
<p class="verse0">For what I gained by work and tact,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d loose by some rebellious act:</p>
<p class="verse0">I sacrificed myself to fun&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">My ablest efforts were undone</p>
<p class="verse0">By some wild freak or fractured rule,</p>
<p class="verse0">That put me down a dot in school.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">I soon began, as heretofore,</p>

<p class="verse0">Indeed it seems a chronic crime,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">To be officious and prevent</p>
<p class="verse0">The pleasures that were my intent.</p>
<p class="verse0">They so delight in being dry</p>
<p class="verse0">And dull and stiff. I wonder why?</p>
<p class="verse0">They looked with frowning doubt and dread</p>
<p class="verse0">On every thing I did and said.</p>
<p class="verse0">At times they’d give a sickly smile</p>
<p class="verse0">At my peculiar wayward style;</p>
<p class="verse0">But in a moment they would be</p>
<p class="verse0">A-pointing morals all at me.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">As we were taught full forty things,</p>
<p class="verse0">With names as long as corset strings,</p>

<p class="verse0">With recollections full of woe.</p>
<p class="verse0">What good is it for us to know</p>
<p class="verse0">That Mars has belts or Saturn rings&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">A thousand other different things?</p>
<p class="verse0">That don’t concern this world at all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor never have since Adam’s fall.</p>

<p>We seldom see a preface in the back of
a book, or a frontispiece in the middle,
but as I have always been considered a
little eccentric, I will make a new departure,
and thank my indulgent readers
here for their patient perusal of these
pages. I locate these honeyed words in
the rear as a reward of merit to any one
that is martyr enough to reach them by
the regular route, and those that have not
energy and endurance enough to do so
deserve to lose these chunks of wisdom
and words of cheer. In the preceding
poems are depicted sentiments to suit my
changing moods; streaks of mirth and
wails of misery; childhood’s mischief and
woman’s woe; a mixture of ecstasy and
agony, to suit “the gay or the grave, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
lively or severe.” Now, should they fail
to find a responsive echo in my readers’
hearts, then is “Othello’s occupation
gone,” and I will fold my hands, dry my
quill, dismiss my muse, and write no
more.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Poetic contractions have been treated consistently. Common contractions
with is or has [such as she’s, there’s, that’s] have no space, but less common
ones have retained the space usually but not always found in the original
book [such as night ’s, turn ’s, mine ’s].</p>

<p>The space has been removed from other common phrases with contractions,
for example ’T was has been changed to ’Twas, can ’t has been
changed to can’t.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.</p>
